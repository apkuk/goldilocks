## Introduction

I spent three decades building organizational capability at Nike, BlackRock, Shell, and Sanofi. I've led talent strategy through market crashes, digital transformations, and countless "this changes everything" moments. A year ago, I left corporate life to sit at what I believe is the most interesting intersection in business right now: where deep domain expertise meets artificial intelligence.

Not the AI of press releases and keynote demos. The AI that either saves your team 200 hours a month or wastes 200 hours trying to make it work.

<KeyPoint

  I analyzed 196 posts from the past month. Thirty-nine percent are about AI. The conversation is split between people who think AI is too cold (overhyped, risky, not ready) and people who think it's too hot (magical, transformative, urgent).
</KeyPoint>

<PullQuote variant="highlight" size="large">
  Both groups are half right, and fully missing the point.
</PullQuote>

The real question isn't whether AI will transform work. It's already doing that. The question is: **Are you designing how that happens in your organization, or are you letting it happen to you?**

Let me show you what I mean by walking through the three camps, and then giving you the operational framework I'm using with clients who are actually getting value from this technology.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Too Cold: When Caution Becomes Its Own Risk

The skeptics have receipts, and they're worth examining carefully.

### The Evidence for Caution

<ExpandableSection title="Legal Liability Is Real" defaultExpanded={true}>

In *Mata v. Avianca* (2023), New York lawyers submitted a legal brief containing six case citations generated by ChatGPT. None of the cases existed. The judge sanctioned the attorneys $5,000. The UK High Court warned that lawyers who cite non-existent AI-generated cases could face contempt charges.

<KeyPoint variant="warning" title="Air Canada Chatbot Disaster" icon="‚ö†Ô∏è">
  Air Canada learned this lesson when their customer service chatbot promised a bereavement fare refund policy that didn't exist. When sued, Air Canada argued the chatbot was a "separate legal entity" responsible for its own actions. The tribunal rejected this entirely: **companies are responsible for all information on their website, including AI-generated content.**
</KeyPoint>

<ExpandableSection title="Hallucinations Aren't Edge Cases">

When the BBC tested major AI chatbots on current-affairs questions, they found **significant issues in over 50% of responses.** Chatbots confidently stated Rishi Sunak was still UK Prime Minister months after he'd left office, fabricated quotes, invented statistics, and misattributed statements.

## Real Example: End-to-End Implementation

**Context:** Global pharmaceutical company, regulatory affairs team, 45 people, processing 200+ regulatory submissions per year.

**Problem:** Team spending 40% of time on mechanical summarization and formatting. Backlog growing. Quality variable. Burnout increasing.

**Solution:** Applied "just right" framework:

## The Timeline You're Operating In

<KeyPoint variant="danger" title="The Gap Opens Fast" icon="‚ö°">
  Organizations that figure this out in the next 12-18 months will have refined workflows that compound efficiency gains, trained teams with operational muscle memory, risk management infrastructure that scales, and competitive moats built on execution speed.
</KeyPoint>

Organizations that wait will be playing catch-up while simultaneously trying to build basic AI literacy, establish governance, redesign legacy processes, and compete with teams that have years of experience.

## What You Need to Do Monday

If you're a leader, here's the conversation you need to have with your team next week:

<PullQuote variant="highlight">
  "We're adopting AI, and we're doing it deliberately. Not because of hype‚Äîbecause the productivity and capability data is real. Not recklessly‚Äîbecause the risk data is also real, and we need frameworks that match controls to consequence."
</PullQuote>

<CheckList
  interactive={true}
  title="Your Monday Action Plan"
  items={[
    "Introduce the CAP¬≤ model to identify capacity and capability opportunities",
    "Implement risk tiers (T0-T3) to determine appropriate controls",
    "Invest in enterprise tools for anything beyond T0 experimentation",
    "Establish measurement system: cycle time, quality, rework rate (monthly)",
    "Launch training program for everyone, not just volunteers",
    "Set 90-day review cycles: scale what works, kill what doesn't",
    "Schedule first workflow mapping session with team leads",
    "Identify T1 pilot workflow to start this quarter"
  ]}
/>

<KeyPoint variant="success" title="This Isn't Optional" icon="üéØ">
  This isn't optional. It's how we stay competitive. The question isn't whether to adopt AI‚Äîit's whether you're designing how that adoption happens, or letting it happen to you.
</KeyPoint>

## The Headline You're Writing

Five years from now, there will be a case study about your organization's AI adoption.

The headline will be one of three:

<div className="my-12 space-y-6">
  <div className="p-6 bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-500 rounded-r-lg">
    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-orange-900 mb-2">"Too Hot"</h3>
    <p className="text-orange-800 italic">"How [Your Company] Spent Millions on AI Theater and Got Minimal Returns"</p>
  </div>

  <div className="p-6 bg-cyan-50 border-l-4 border-cyan-500 rounded-r-lg">
    <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-900 mb-2">"Just Right"</h3>
    <p className="text-cyan-800 italic">"How [Your Company] Captured 40% Efficiency Gains Through Disciplined AI Adoption"</p>
  </div>

    <p className="text-amber-800 italic">"How [Your Company] Watched Competitors Pull Ahead While They Debated Safety"</p>
  </div>

## My Final Thought

I spent 30 years building capability in organizations. I've seen countless "this changes everything" moments. Most don't. But a few do.

<PullQuote variant="highlight" size="large">
  AI is one that does.
</PullQuote>

Not because it's magic. Because it's a lever long enough to move the weight of work that's been unchanged for decades.

But leverage works both ways. Use it well, and you multiply your impact. Use it poorly, and you multiply your mistakes.

<PullQuote variant="highlight" size="large">
  The choice isn't whether AI will change your work. It's whether you're designing how that change happens, or letting it happen to you.
</PullQuote>

I know which one I'd choose.
